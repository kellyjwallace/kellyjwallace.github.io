<p style="text-align:center;font-size:110%">I grew up in Easton, Pennsylvania and earned my bachelor's degree at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. At Cornell I sang a cappella and was introduced to behavioral ecology and neurobiology while researching prairie vole behavior in the lab of Dr. Alex Ophir. <br><br> In 2015 I joined the Ecology, Evolution, and PhD program at the University of Texas at Austin. I currently research social decision-making in cichlid fish, advised by Dr. Hans Hofmann & Dr. Mike Ryan. If I'm not running fish through mazes, you can find me camping around Texas, playing the viola, or searching for the best happy hours in Austin.</p>
