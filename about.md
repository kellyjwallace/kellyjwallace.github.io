<p style="text-align:center;font-size:120%">I grew up in Easton, Pennsylvania and earned my bachelor's degree at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. At Cornell I sang a cappella and was introduced behavioral ecology and neorbiology while working on prairie voles in the lab of Dr. Alex Ophir. <br><br> In 2015 I joined the Ecology, Evolution, and PhD program at the University of Texas at Austin. If I'm not running fish through mazes, you can usually find me camping around Texas, playing the viola, or meticulously searching for the best happy hours in Austin.</p>
