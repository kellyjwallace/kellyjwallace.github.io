<p style="text-align:left;font-size:120%"><b><font color="darkslateblue">Postdoctoral research: Early life social complexity shapes adult neural processing in the communal spiny mouse Acomys cahirinus</font></b><br></p>

Early life social rearing has profound consequences on offspring behavior and resilience. Yet most studies examining early life development in rodents use species whose young are born immobile and do not produce complex social behavior until later in development. Furthermore, models of rearing under increased social complexity, rather than social deprivation, are needed to provide alternative insight into the development of social neural circuitry. In her postdoctoral resarch Dr. Wallace manipulated early life social complexity in the spiny mouse <i>Acomys cahirinus</i>. Early life social experience did not influence adult behavior, but it did influence social processing: lateral septal neural responses toward a novel conspecific and hypothalamic neural responses toward a novel mixed-sex group differed in animals raised in socially complex and socially simple environments. Her work suggests that communal species may exhibit robust behavioral resilience to the early life social environment, but the early life environment can affect how novel social information is processed in the brain during adulthood. <br><br>

During her doctoral research Dr. Wallace assessed male <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, an African cichlid fish known for its dynamic social dominance hierarchies, in a set of cognitive tasks both before and after a community perturbation in which some individuals ascended in dominance status to become territorial. Dr. Wallace discovered that ascending males changed their physiology and novel object recognition preference during the perturbation, and they subsequently differed in social competence from subordinate individuals. Additionally, Dr. Wallace identified specific cognitive and physiological attributes that appeared to predispose certain individuals to ascend in social status. These previously undiscovered relationships between social ascent and cognition emphasized the broad influence of social dominance on animal decision-making.
