<p style="color:darkslateblue"><em> I'm interested in understanding how an individual's social environment influences how they behave and make decisions. I have investigated this question across three model systems: cichlid fish, mosquitofish, and prairie voles. These three systems are well known for their dynamic and varied social interactions, a historical foundation on the neural and hormonal mechanisms of social behavior and decision-making, and integration of broad eco-evolutionary frameworks. <br></em></p>

<p style="text-align:left;font-size:120%"><b><font color="darkslateblue">Neuroendocrine basis of social competence and cognition in dynamic communities of a highly soical cichlid fish <i>(Astatotilapia burtoni)</i></font></b><br></p>


Individual variation in “cognitive style” (how an individual approaches a cognitive task) can be predicted by more general consistent behaviors such as aggression, neophobia, and sociability. Social competence, the ability to make context-appropriate behavioral decisions, thus should be influenced by cognitive style and general behavioral tendencies. Yet we know very little about how the social environment influences the neuromolecular processes underlying this interconnected web of social competence, cognitive style and behavioral tendencies. <br><br> My dissertation work investigates this intersection by manipulating naturalistic communities of the cichlid fish <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, a model system in social neuroscience, to quantify the behavioral styles and space use patterns of socially dominant and subordinate individuals. <b>I assess individuals’ cognitive performance and style by testing them in a spatial maze, followed by a reversal, a novel object recognition task, and a social competence task.</b> This test suite is repeated after an experimental perturbation that allows some subordinate males to ascend in social status. <b>Throughout, I assay circulating glucocorticoid and androgen levels. I then use quantitative real-time PCR of the immediate-early genes egr-1 and c-fos</b> to determine to which extent the neural activity patterns in core nodes of the vertebrate social decision-making network (SDMN) correlate with behavior, cognitive style and performance, and social competence. Finally, <b>I also measure the activity of genes associated with stress reactivity and social behavior</b>. Taken together, this experimental design provides a uniquely comprehensive investigation of the cognitive, behavioral, and mechanistic underpinnings of decision-making in a complex and dynamic social community.

<p style="text-align:left;font-size:120%"><b><font color="darkslateblue">Sex differences in cognitive performance, style and domain relationships in mosquitofish <i>(Gambusia affinis)</i></font></b><br></p>

Given that the sexes often differ in their ecological and sexual selection pressures, sex differences in cognitive properties are likely. While research on sexually dimorphic cognition often focuses on performance, it commonly overlooks how sexes diverge across multiple cognitive tasks (cognitive domains) and in behaviors associated with cognitive performance (cognitive style). We tested male and female western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) in three cognitive tasks: associative learning (numerical discrimination), cognitive flexibility (detour task), and spatio-temporal learning (shuttlebox). We characterized statistical relationships between cognitive performances and cognitive style during the associative learning task with measures of anxiety, boldness, exploration, reaction time, and activity. <b>We found sex differences in performance, cognitive style, and the relationships between cognitive domains.</b> Females outperformed males in spatio-temporal learning task, while the sexes performed equally in associate learning and cognitive flexibility assays. Females exhibited a ‘fast-exploratory’ cognitive style during associative learning trials. Meanwhile, only males showed a significant positive relationship between domains (associative learning and cognitive flexibility). We propose that these sexually dimorphic cognitive traits result from strong sexual conflict in this taxon; and emphasize the need to explore suites of sex-specific cognitive traits and broader comparative work examining sexual selection and cognition.<br><br>

<p style="text-align:left;font-size:120%"><b><font color="darkslateblue">Sex differences in hippocampal CA1 cell densities in relation to oxytocin expression <i>(Microtus ochrogaster)</i></font></b><br></p>
As part of my undergraduate research, I sectioned, stained (cresyl violet), and imaged hippocampal slices of male and female prairie voles <i> (Microtus ochrogaster) </i>, then developed a grid overlay using ImageJ and calculated cell density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This work contributed to the characterization of sex differences in oxytocin receptor density in prairie vole hippocampi, and highlights an expanded mechanistic role for oxytocin as an integrator of social and spatial information. <br>
