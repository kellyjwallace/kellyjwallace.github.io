<p style="text-align:left;font-size:110%"><b>Dr. Kelly Miller-Wallace</b> grew up in Easton, Pennsylvania and earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell University. At Cornell she minored in music and was introduced to neurobiology while researching prairie vole behavior in the lab of Dr. Alex Ophir. In 2020 she completed her PhD in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at the University of Texas at Austin. Her dissertation explored social decision-making in fish, advised by Dr. Hans Hofmann & Dr. Mike Ryan. In 2021 she conducted postdoctoral research in the lab of Dr. Aubrey Kelly at Emory University with the funding of an NSF PRFB, where she investigated early life social development in the communal spiny mouse. In 2024 she joined the Amherst College Department of Biology & Program in Neuroscience. Her lab studies cognitive ecology and social neuroscience in Betta fish. When she's not taking videos of fish, you can find Dr. Wallace ice skating or growing ground cherries in her garden.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-aquino-vasquez-3886081bb"><b>Dr. Elaine Aquino Vasquez</b></a> is a research technician in the Wallace Lab. Dr. Aquino Vasquez completed her PhD at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Her doctoral research on neural regeneration following brain injury assessed the effects of various therapeutic treatments on microgia morphology. <br><br>

<a href="https://jeremyspool.com"><b>Dr. Jeremy Spool</b></a> is a postdoctoral researcher in the Wallace Lab. Dr. Spool completed his PhD at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. His doctoral research studied how limited resources and hormones affect the brain and behavior in Eurpoean starlings and Common Loons. Prior to joining the Wallace Lab, Dr. Spool conducted postdoctoral research at UMass Amherst to understand how social auditory information reaches hormone-sensitive brain regions in Zebra finches. <br><br>
