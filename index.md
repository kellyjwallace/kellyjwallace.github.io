<p style="text-align:left;font-size:120%">Dr. Kelly Miller-Wallace is an integrative neurobiologist investigating how the social environment influences cognition. <br><br>
	
<i>The Wallace Lab uses behavioral, physiological, and neuromolecular techniques to understand how an individual's social environment shapes their decisions. This research builds on the foundational literature of social neuroendocrinology by incorporating cognitive and eco-evolutionary frameworks. The lab explores these topics using fish species (Betta splendens and Astatotilapia burtoni) that are known for their dynamic social interactions. <br><br></i>

<b>Are you an Amherst College undergraduate interested in joining the lab?</b> <br><br>


Thank you so much for your interest! Importantly, I only allow students to do research in my lab via two mechanisms: SURF or a Senior Honors Thesis. I unfortunately do not offer open lab meetings or shadow opportunities. If you do not qualify for the two mechanisms listed, please take my class <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/2324S/BIOL/BIOL-313-2324S"><b>BIOL/NEUR 313: Social Neuroendocrinology</b></a>! In the class you design and conduct a semester-long hands on research experience that involves live animal handling, immunohistochemical staining of brain tissue, and microscopy, teaching you all the same skills you would learn doing research in my lab.<br><br>

<b>Interested in Summer Research?</b> I accept rising sophomores and juniors to conduct research for 8 weeks over the summer in my lab through Summer Science undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF). Please look at the <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/student-faculty-research/surf-program"><b>SURF website</b></a> for more information. Applications for SURF are typically due in mid-February. Because SURF typically has a large number of applicants, I give preference to students who have also filled out <a href="https://kellyjwallace.github.io/images/Wallace_Lab_Questionnaire.pdf"><b>this questionnaire</b></a>. I know the questionnaire looks intense, but it’s just a way for me to get to know you better so don’t stress,  just answer the prompts as best you can!<br><br>

<b>Interested in a Senior Thesis?</b> I typically prioritize students who major in Biology or Neuroscience majors for a senior thesis in my lab. Importantly, beginning with the class of 2027 I will only accept thesis students who have taken my upper level lab course, <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/2324S/BIOL/BIOL-313-2324S"><b>BIOL/NEUR 313: Social Neuroendocrinology</b></a>. 313 is only offered in the spring semester, so if you plan to go abroad your junior year you should consider either taking my course in your sophomore year or going abroad your junior fall (for example to <a href="https://disabroad.org/academic-programs/"><b>The Danish Institute for Study Abroad (DIS) Program </b></a> in Stockholm and Copenhagen!). Please also note that I require thesis students in my lab to conduct their data collection the summer before their senior year. During this summer thesis work you are paid and receive on campus housing and meals. If you are interested in conducting a thesis in my lab, please fill out <a href="https://kellyjwallace.github.io/images/Wallace_Lab_Questionnaire.pdf"><b>this questionnaire</b></a>. I know the questionnaire looks intense, but it’s just a way for me to get to know you better so don’t stress, so just answer the prompts as best you can!<br><br>

Thank you again for your research interest!
