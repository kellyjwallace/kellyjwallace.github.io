Since 2019 I have served on the <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/diversity/d-i-committee"> <b> UT College of Natural Sciences Diversity and Inclusion Committee</b> </a> which has organized college-wide initiatives such as the “You Belong Here” campaign, gender-neutral bathrooms, diversity award funding, and a college-wide lunch-series.<br><br>

In summer 2020 I was invited by the College of Natural Sciences Dean Goldbart to join a 15-member <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/news/your-ideas-in-a-time-of-momentum"> <b> UT College of Natural Sciences Action Team on Racial Justice</b></a> that assessed needs and priorities in response to a college-wide request for action.<br><br>

I am one of three founding student representatives of the <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program/diversity#diversity-amp-inclusivity-committee"> <b> Integrative Biology Department Diversity and Inclusivity Committee </b></a>. The committee develops policies and procedures for handling student concerns and encouraging diversity in applicants to the affiliated graduate programs. <br><br>

As part of the department's <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program/diversity#equity-and-inclusion-discussion-group"><b>Equity and Inclusion Discussion Group </b></a>, in Fall 2019 I co-developed and led a seminar and discussion on <b> Equitable and Inclusive Recruitment Practices</b> (which broadly included recruiting graduate students, postdoctoral reserachers, and faculty). This event led to the creation of a “Diverse Recruitment Resource Guide” for the department. <br><br>

In Spring 2019 (also as part of the department's Equity and Inclusion Discussion Group) I co-developed and led a seminar and discussion on <b> Sexual Harassment in Field Research</b>, which consisted of paper discussions and walkthroughs of scenarios. <br><br>

I participated in a <a href="https://beacon-center.org/"> <b> BEACON</b></a>-funded project titled <b>African American Pioneers in Evolutionary Science: The Untold Story</b> that met in 2017 to develop scholarly 
publications on the history/sociology of African American scientists in evolution and generate goals for improving diversity recruitment and inclusivity for students in evolutionary biology.<br><br>

In 2016 I collaborated with the UT Austin EEB PhD Program to run a <b> social media campaign during Black History Month </b> (February) to celebrate black scientists. This work inspired an additional program highlighting Hispanic-American scientists.<br><br>

The <a href="http://www.girladvocates.org/"> <b> GirlAdvocates!</b></a> program provides primarily minority local middle school students opportunities to engage in science in their community. In 2015 organized a lab outreach event which included a lab tour, activities, and a student panel discussion about being a woman in science.<br><br>

The article describes efforts by the graduate students in UT's Integrative Biology Department to improve cultural issues in the department and academia as a whole, specifically as it relates to addressing racial insensitivity and sexism. <br>

Through the <a href="https://world.utexas.edu/isss/programs/passport-to-ut"><b>Passport to UT Mentorship Program </b> </a>I have mentored three international students (China, Ghana) during their transition to the United States and to the University of Texas at Austin. <br><br>

The <b>Crockett High School Mentorship Program</b> brings students from Crockett High School (an urban campus with primarily minority and low socioeconomic status enrollment) into a research environment at UT. I have mentored three high school students on their independent research projects, as well as led paper discussions and guided development of research presentations. <br><br>

I have judged oral and posted presentations for the <b>Capital of Texas Undergraduate Research Conference</b> and the <b>University of Texas at Austin College of Natural Sciences Undergraduate Research Forum </b><br>

Gathering and evaluating data on representation in academia is the first step to identifying areas to target inclusive programming efforts. In our preprint <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/848101v1"> <b> Using a Systems Change Framework to Evaluate Academic Equity & Climate Efforts in a Graduate Program</b></a> Julia York and I gathered information about the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin and its PhD program in Ecology, Evolution, and Beehavior. In the manuscript we discuss how graduate programs can evaluate their inclusive programming efforts in order to make the most efficient and positive impact. <br>

As the <b>EEB Program's Graduate Student Representative</b> from 2018-2019, I attended faculty meetings and disseminated information to students. I organized town hall events, designed and administered a survey on the graduate student curriculum, developed a student writing group, and advocated for student concerns. <br><br>


While I was the Graduate Student Representative I implemented a <b>Mentoring Plan</b> designed to clarify expectations and responsibilities between incoming students and their advisors. The Mentoring Plan is a survey-like document that the
student and advisor complete together soon after the student arrives (answering questions like frequency of meetings, preferred communication, strengths and weaknesses, etc). The two revisit to the document in the student’s second semester to assess and update their plan. This plan is also being used as a template for the UT CMB (Cell & Molecular Biology) Graduate Program <br><br>

As part of the EEB Program's First Year Subjects and Skills Course, I participated in a <b>graduate student panel</b> and spoke on topics such as how to begin research projects, TA responsibilities, and on-campus resources for graduate students. <br><br>

<a href="https://austinscienceadvocates.wordpress.com/"> <b> Austin Science Advocates</b></a> promotes science communication and science policy awareness. As part of the planning team I have helped with guest speaker events, skills workshops, and “contact your local representative” sessions. <br><br>

In Fall of 2019 I organized a weekly graduate <b>student writing group</b> for students in the EEB Program. <br><br>
