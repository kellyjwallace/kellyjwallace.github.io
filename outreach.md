During my PhD at UT Austin I served on the <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/diversity/d-i-committee"> <b> UT College of Natural Sciences Diversity and Inclusion Committee</b> </a> which has organized college-wide initiatives such as the “You Belong Here” campaign, gender-neutral bathrooms, diversity award funding, and a college-wide lunch-series. In summer 2020 I was invited by the College of Natural Sciences Dean Goldbart to join a 15-member <b> UT College of Natural Sciences Action Team on Racial Justice</b> that assessed needs and priorities in response to a college-wide request for action.<br><br>

The article describes efforts by the graduate students in UT's Integrative Biology Department to improve cultural issues in the department and academia as a whole, specifically as it relates to addressing racial insensitivity and sexism. <br><br>

Individual power in academic spaces is multi-faceted and identity-dependent. In a publication in <i> Hormones & Behavior </i> I and other members of the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology provide action strategies for addressing racial inequity in academia, from the individual to the structural level. In the publication we also invite readers to critically examine how their identities contribute to their power and to subsequently reflect on which action strategies can leverage that power. <br><br>

Gathering and evaluating data on representation in academia is the first step to identifying areas to target inclusive programming efforts. In our publication in <i> Ecology and Evolution </i> Julia York and I analyzed information about the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin and its PhD program in Ecology, Evolution, and Beehavior. In the manuscript we discuss how graduate programs can evaluate their inclusive programming efforts in order to make the most efficient and positive impact. <br>

In 2017 I participated in an <b>NSF BEACON</b>-funded project titled <b>African American Pioneers in Evolutionary Science: The Untold Story</b> that met to develop scholarly publications on the history/sociology of African American scientists in evolution and generate goals for improving diversity recruitment and inclusivity for students in evolutionary biology.<br><br>
