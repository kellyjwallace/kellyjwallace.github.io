The article describes efforts by the graduate students in UT's Integrative Biology Department to improve cultural issues in the department and academia as a whole, specifically as it relates to addressing racial insensitivity and sexism. <br><br>

Through the <a href="https://world.utexas.edu/isss/programs/passport-to-ut"><b>Passport to UT Mentorship Program </b> </a>I have mentored three international students (China, Ghana) during their transition to the United States and to the University of Texas at Austin. <br><br>

The <b>Crockett High School Mentorship Program</b> brings students from Crockett High School (an urban campus with primarily minority and low socioeconomic status enrollment) into a research environment at UT. I have mentored two high school students on their independent research projects, as well as led paper discussions and guided development of research presentations. <br><br>

I have judged oral and posted presentations for the <b>Capital of Texas Undergraduate Research Conference</b> and the <b>University of Texas at Austin College of Natural Sciences Undergraduate Research Forum </b><br>

EEB Graduate Student Representative <br>
As the student representative, I attended faculty meetings and disseminated information. I 
organized town hall events, designed and administered a survey on the graduate student 
curriculum, developed a student writing group, and advocated for student concerns. <br><br>
EEB Program Mentorship Plan <br>
I implemented a Mentoring Plan designed to clarify expectations/responsibilities between 
incoming students and their advisors. The Mentoring Plan is a survey-like document that the
student and advisor complete together soon after the student arrives (answering questions like frequency of meetings, preferred communication, strengths and weaknesses, etc). The two revisit to the document in the student’s second semester to assess and update their plan. This plan is also being used as a template for the UT CMB (Cell & Molecular Biology) Graduate Program <br><br>

Austin Science Advocates(https://austinscienceadvocates.wordpress.com/) <br>
Austin Science Advocates promotes science communication and science policy awareness. I am on the planning team which organizes guest speaker events, skills workshops, and “contact your local representative” sessions. <br><br>
